/* The practice ground (akhara): rehearsal, and nothing more (Change List item 23, option 1).
   - Reached from the menu between scenes, offered beside a second chance after a failed test
     ("Practise first, then try again"), and after a lost fight that was not deadly.
   - Every kind of test met in this life, or in a life kept in the Book of Lives, can be played
     again here; kinds not met yet stay locked.
   - Sparring under the real rules of a fight against a training partner: a straw dummy, a fellow
     student or the teacher (never the named opponent who beat you). No one is hurt.
   - Reading the blow: jump a low blow, duck a high one, step aside from a thrust or a charge,
     block anything; slow at first, then faster.
   - The teacher's puppet gives a tip for each kind and shows how ("Show me"). Three speeds: slow and
     normal slow the game clock down; real is the speed of the test itself.
   Nothing done here counts. Everything runs on a copy of the life: whatever a test or a bout
   touches (herbs used, a scar, a ring held) is put back exactly as it was when it ends, and the
   record of fights and tests never hears of it. Never in the middle of a deadly fight, a perilous
   choice or a timed moment. The automated playthroughs never come here. */
