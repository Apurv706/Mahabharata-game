/* Fights of other kinds in the war (PRD fights, owner's ideas 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 14; 2 Nov).
   The new kinds go into small side battles only. Every main fight keeps its form and length
   (tests/rules.js 90), except the two day-17 fights in war_duel.js, which are driven as chariot duels.

   An encounter's `kind` picks how it is fought (engine/combat.js reads K.FIGHT_KINDS):
   - on the turns (B.rule): "escort" (keep someone whole, or the fight is lost), "breakthrough" (each
     round choose a lane, each its own foe and cost, until you are through), "weather" (no striking
     back: guard in time and take cover, and live through it);
   - live, by the screen (B.mode, ui/fightmodes.js): "chariot" (the race, with a bow and contact),
     "range" (the aim test against a running chariot, his arrows to duck), "mace" (the parry drill with
     maces, and feints), "carry" (the steady test under arrows). With motion off, and under the tests,
     these are fought as the plain hold they are written as.
   Every side battle is a hold of four rounds with one twist (idea 14).

   Where they come:
   A. By path, on days 6 and 11 (one skirmish each, optional): archer → range, charioteer → chariot,
      mace → mace, healer → carry / escort, spy → breakthrough (in the mist), strategist → escort /
      breakthrough, everyone else → the hold.
   B. On the canon days: Bhishma's arrows on day 3 (Pandava, weather); Supratika on day 12 (both sides,
      weather); the outer ring on day 13 (Pandava: a breakthrough that cannot succeed; Kaurava: the hold);
      the road to Jayadratha on day 14 (Pandava charioteers, chariot); the Narayana weapon on day 15
      (Pandava, weather: lay down your weapons); an archer across the field on day 16 (archers, range);
      a champion on day 18 (mace fighters, mace); after a broken hold, carry a wounded man out (carry).
   K.fightKind keeps it to one special kind on any war day of a life. Flags: fk_<day>_<kind>,
   fs_carried. */
