/* War storylines (PRD 18.13): Yuyutsu's call: the only way to change sides (#1).
   Before the first arrow Yudhishthira calls across the field that anyone may still change sides, and
   Yuyutsu, Dhritarashtra's son, crosses to the Pandavas. Every life at the war meets the call on the
   first morning (cross_call, before a6_day1):
   - on the Kaurava side you may cross with him. S.side becomes "pandava" and everything keyed by side
     follows it (the war days, letters, the map's camp). Every bond on the side you left falls by 3 and
     a friend for life there ends at once; crossing counts as retreat. The new side gives you a place,
     not trust: no rank (every role_ and council_ flag goes, a commander's company with them, and you
     fight as role_front; healers and bards keep their work), and no call for help (crossed_untrusted)
     while the new side suspects you are a spy (suspected_spy, with crossed_untrusted for K.warHelp).
     A guard sleeps across your tent door (cross_watched). You prove yourself (proved(): trust, the call
     for help, and rank again: a commander who left a company behind is given one, company_given_back,
     and command.js's promotions follow) by any of:
       - killing the man your old side sends on the second morning (proven_duel). Sparing him feeds the
         suspicion, unless you can explain it to Dhrishtadyumna (cross_explain, statecraft: proven_spared);
       - the truth before Yudhishthira on the third night (cross_truth, a retort test): something true
         about the army you left. Bonds there fall by 1, and conscience by 1 for the men it kills (proven_truth);
       - the fourth night, when a real spy copies the array and you are blamed (cross_spy, a notice test):
         remember the man well enough and he is caught (proven_spy).
     Not proven by the fourth night, you are suspected for the war (suspected_war): no rank, no call for
     help, the worst postings, a spearman two paces behind you, and a line in the telling.
     Flags: crossed_lines, crossed_to_pandava;
   - on the Pandava side you may call your sibling across (a test of statecraft against their loyalty):
     if they come they fight beside you for the war (S.calledAcross, K.warAllies); either way they
     remember. A friend for life on the other side (Karna, Duryodhana) can be called, and will not come:
     canon;
   - or stand still. Those in the healers' tents only watch.
   On the second morning (cross_duel) your old side sends someone to bring you back or kill you: Ugra
   if he stood beside you, else Kanaka, a comrade of your old company. A caller whose sibling came
   fights beside them against the riders sent after them (cross_called).
