/* War storylines (PRD 18.13): The lake (#8) and Iravan (#2).
   Scenes here come before the war days through K.BEFORE, each only when it applies.
   - Iravan (day 8, before the tenth day): Pandava players with a naga tie (the serpent-noose, taught
     by the naga they healed on the riverbank) ride beside Arjuna's son by Ulupi against Shakuni's
     horse, a holding fight of six rounds. At dusk he is dead (the rakshasa Alambusha, canon), and his
     body can be carried across the field to the river under fire (a stealth test). Done, and once in
     the war a naga of Ulupi's people answers a call for help (K.nagaHelp, read by K.warHelp).
   - The lake (day 18, after the last battle, before the duel): spies, scouts and Duryodhana's friends
     search the reeds of Dvaipayana at dusk before the hunters do (a noticing test); fight in the reeds
     after dark, beside Ashwatthama, Kripa and Kritavarma or against them (they cannot be killed); then
     tell the Pandavas, keep silent, or warn him to flee. He never runs, the hunters always tell, and
     the duel is fought as written. Losing the fight out of your depth is a death; a Pandava seen
     warning him, out of their depth, spends the duel in a cell.
