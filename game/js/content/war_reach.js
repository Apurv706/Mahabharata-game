/* Reaching more lives (PRD reach, 2 Nov): how a life is tied to each war storyline, the word the
   night before, the war-day map, and small ties seeded in Acts III and IV. Loaded before the
   storyline files, which read these helpers and hang the scenes below in their own K.BEFORE lists.

   Ties, strongest first (K.reachTie):
   - "own": the storyline's special entrance (Panchala-born carry their own king, and so on);
   - "company": a company leader or division officer whose company still stands is posted there by
     the morning's orders;
   - "friend": a friend at your side asked you along the night before (wr_word_*);
   - "letter": you went on the word that went round the camp (wr_word_*);
   - "general": you chose that part of the field on the morning's map (wr_map_*).
   The opening scene says in one line how a weaker tie brought you (K.tieLine). Only fighters (front
   line, a chariot or a company) are drawn in by a weaker tie.
   Where: the word before Iravan's day (8) and the lake (18); the map on the morning of day 14
   (Bhurishravas and the Shakti) and, for the Pandavas, day 15 (the two kings and Drona's chariot).
   Flags: friend_<story>, heard_<story>, spot_<story>, stayed_<story> (story: iravan, lake, bhuri,
   shakti, kings, drona). Seeds: met_satyaki (the swayamvara), saw_vrishasena (Anga, before the dice). */
