/* War storylines (PRD 18.13): Bhurishravas (#4) and your king falls (#6).
   Scenes here come before the war days through K.BEFORE, each only when it applies. Ids begin kb_
   (Bhurishravas, day 14) and kf_ (the kings, day 15).

   Who meets Bhurishravas: fighters on either side (front line, a chariot or a company; healers and
   bards stay in the tents) who are Yadava (born in Mathura or serving Dwaraka), lead a company
   (role_command), or are close to Satyaki (bond 4 or more). On the Kaurava side, also the Kuru court's
   own fighters (serving Hastinapura): Bhurishravas is a Kuru, of Bahlika's house, and the old court's
   levies stand in his division.
   Who meets the kings' fall: Pandava-side players born in Panchala or Matsya, or serving Drupada's or
   Virata's court (the court served comes first). The moment Dhrishtadyumna goes for Drona is also
   met by Drona's own students on either side.

   Canon is untouched: Arjuna's arrow takes Bhurishravas's arm and Satyaki beheads him; Drona kills
   Drupada and Virata, and Dhrishtadyumna kills Drona as he sits. The player holds, tries, carries,
   looks away, and is remembered for it.
   Flags: kb_held_full / kb_held_short / kb_fell_back, kb_tried_stop, kb_held_arms, kb_looked_away,
   kb_carried_body, kb_left_body, kb_said_*; kf_carried_king, kf_rode_with_dhrishta, kf_broke_debt,
   kf_tried_stop_d, kf_kept_away, kf_stood_between, kf_let_it_happen, kf_took_word, kf_stayed.
   Second pass (2 Nov): every Pandava fighter is ordered to ride with Satyaki through the Kaurava army
   on day 14 (kb_ride); riding leads on to Bhurishravas, refusing keeps you by Yudhishthira. On day 15
   every Pandava on the field meets the cry "Ashwatthama is dead" (kf_cry), which is a lie for the vow
   never to lie. The night debate moves to the night of day 15 and argues both deaths.
   Flags: kb_rode, kb_ride_through, kb_stayed_king, kf_cried, kf_silent, kf_ash_knows.
   S.kbRide: how fresh Satyaki is when Bhurishravas finds him (2 fresh, 1 worn, 0 spent).
   S.kbHeld: the rounds Bhurishravas was held off Satyaki (0 to 6). S.missed: scenes passed by while
   away from the camp (a ride home), which K.BEFORE no longer offers (engine/flow.js). */
