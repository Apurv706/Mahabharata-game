/* War storylines (PRD 18.13): The Samshaptakas: the oath to the death (#3).
   Scenes here come before the war days through K.BEFORE, each only when it applies.
   Kaurava side: on the night of the eleventh day the Trigarta brothers and their men swear to fight
   Arjuna until he dies or they do, to draw him away from Yudhishthira. You may swear with them: a
   fourth vow above the limit of three (K.VOWS.samshaptaka.overLimit, core.js vowTake), for this war
   only. While it holds: +2 attack, +1 defence (combat.js); tapas +3 when sworn. Its price: you hold
   in front of Arjuna's chariot every day he comes for the sworn men. Chosen here as two days: the
   twelfth (the first challenge) and the sixteenth (Karna's first day in command, when Arjuna turns on
   the Samshaptakas again). Arjuna does not fall, so the oath ends with the war (released after the
   eighteenth day). Withdrawing breaks it (the withdraw_oath tag, core.js vowBreak: every watcher's
   bond -3), and the telling names you oath-breaker. Falling with the oath on you is its own ending,
   "The oath to the death" (act7.js); story mode carries you off with a wound, the oath kept.
   Pandava side: while Arjuna is drawn south, you are in the crescent array that holds Drona's eagle
   off the king: an army battle for those with a company, the horn beside Bhima for anyone. If it
   breaks where you stand, a holding fight at Yudhishthira's chariot follows (Drona; Satyajit falls,
   as he does in the epic, and the king is never taken).
   Flags: samshaptaka, oath_held_12, oath_held_16, oath_withdrew, oath_carried_off, broke_samshaptaka
   (core.js); crescent_held, crescent_broke, king_held_12, king_guard_broke. */
