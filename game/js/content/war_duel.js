/* War storyline (PRD 18.13): Day 17 · the great duel, Arjuna and Karna (#8). Ids begin kd_.

   Who meets it: fighters on day 17 (front line, a chariot or a company; healers and bards stay in the
   tents). Kaurava side: before noon Arjuna kills Karna's son Vrishasena in front of his father; you
   ride at Vrishasena's wheel in a holding fight and keep him alive as long as you can. He falls when
   it ends, however long you held (canon). Karna sees: four rounds or more and his bond rises and his
   last words name it (through K.karnaLastWords, war_child.js); withdrawing early and it falls, and he
   does not look at you again (no warm last words at all). Then the wheel scene, at his side.
   Pandava side: you ride with the Panchala princes Yudhamanyu and Uttamaujas at Arjuna's wheels, a
   holding fight against Kaurava chariots while the two champions trade divine weapons overhead (each
   exchange drawn in code with ui/fx.js astraFx, a counter-weapon clash). Held to the end, and on the
   night of the raid the princes remember you as they die in the camp (canon). Broken, and Arjuna's
   flank lies open for a round: a wound, and your company shaken in its next fight (company_shaken).
   Never offered under the vow never to strike Karna, nor to a division that already held Karna's
   chariot that day (command.js hold_karna).
   Vrishasena and Karna die on day 17 in every life: the wheel scene's witness names Vrishasena for
   those who were not there, and its closing beat is untouched.
   Flags: kd_stood / kd_fell_short / kd_withdrew / kd_kept_line; kd_guard_held / kd_guard_broken /
   kd_guard_declined. S.kdHeld: rounds Vrishasena was kept alive (0 to 6); S.kdGuard: rounds at the wheel. */
