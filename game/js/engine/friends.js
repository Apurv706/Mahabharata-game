/* Friends who come to help (PRD §18.1). In any fight you may shout for a friend once; who comes
   depends on what you have been to them, and on where they could be. The war's fights keep their
   own rule (K.warHelp in act6a.js); this is the rule for every other fight.
   - A friend comes at a bond of 7 or more, or your friend for life at 5 or more.
   - Only where they could be: not a friend who is dead or whose friendship has ended; not Arjuna in
     the years of the exile he spent away (ages 34 to 40); no Pandava or Kaurava prince in the hidden
     year (age 43), when being seen would give the Pandavas away; not Karna or Duryodhana after you
     have taken the Pandava side, nor Arjuna or Bhima after the Kaurava side.
   - A friend who helps can be hurt: below two fifths of their strength when the fight ends, they
     carry a scar for you (remembered); Charu, who has no armour, can die in a deadly fight. */
