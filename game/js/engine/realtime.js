/* Real-time fights (PRD §18.15), the engine. A deterministic fixed-step simulation (60 steps a
   second, every chance drawn from K.rng) of one fight on a 1-D ground: x runs 0..1 across the field
   (9.5 bodies wide on every screen), and three depth rows (u.rt.lane: 0 front .. 2 back, a float while
   a unit steps between them; owner, 3 November): you hold the front row and your side stands in the
   rows behind; a foe steps into its target's row to strike and waits in a back row; a beaten foe (one
   that may be spared) kneels in the back row; blows reach a row across a little shorter; bodies in one
   row keep apart (no more than about a quarter of a body overlapping); arrows cross rows.

   It rides on the turn-based engine (engine/combat.js): K.Combat.start builds the fight (the units,
   your stats, the fight's allies and enemies, curses, intro lines), every blow is K.Combat's own
   B.hit through the abilities' own use() (so vows, the kavacha, crits, guard, holding fights and the
   log behave as in the turns), and the end is K.Combat.settle (scars, the friend who came, the
   "combat" event), followed by K.combatOutcome as for any fight. Only time is new.

   One fight at a time: RT.begin(B) → R; RT.step(R, act) advances one step with one input
   { move: -1|0|1, strike, roll, rollDir, block (held), skill, herbs, astra: id, call, orders: { friend, soldiers },
     withdraw, spare: uid } (the screen and the bot drive it alike); R.over is "win" | "lose" | "flee"
   | "spare" when it has ended, or "retry" when a deadly fight was lost the first time (RT.retry).
   RT.autoplay(encId) plays a whole fight with the bot (tests/headless): the outcome, as the turns give.

   Rules every enemy keeps (binding): a wind-up of at least 0.3 s, flashing orange; its mark fills to
   the rim exactly as the blow lands; an arrow's lane tracks its target, then locks (white) before the
   release; at most two foes attack at once, the rest wait at a distance; a foe winds up only when
   fully on the field. You stay a tenth of the field from either edge; foes stay on once in. Your own
   side never blocks you, and a blow marked on a friend lands on you if you stand in its path. */
